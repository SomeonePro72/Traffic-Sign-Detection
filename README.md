##Traffic_sign_detect_tensorflow

The project is aimed at creating a system for detecting traffic signs in images using machine learning. The system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to detect the traffic signs. The CNN is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks.
